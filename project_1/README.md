# Project 1: Automatic Review Analyzer

The goal of this project is to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. The training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.

* __project1.py__ contains various useful functions and function templates used to implement the learning algorithms.

* __main.py__ is a script skeleton where these functions are called to run the experiments.

* __utils.py__ contains some pre-written utility functions.
